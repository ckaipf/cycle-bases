# Introduction

This Wiki is intended to document and structure the activitites for the project work in the course 'Advanced methods of bioinformatics' ([bioinf home page](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/teaching/currentClasses/class233.html)) for the summer semester of 2017.

The goal of the course is to develop a tool box for calculating minimal cycles bases ([[MCB]]) of graphs. These are based on the [[MCB-greedy method]], a method to derive an [[MCB]] from the set of cycles of the graph.

Algorithms implemented for this toolbox are the [[Horton]] and [[dePina]] algorithms.

# Structure

The structure of this wiki is as follows:

In [[Gauss]] efforts will be described to implement the [Gaussian elimination algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) for the ring of whole numbers and finite fields.

Furtheron, [[Horton]] and [[dePina]], the Horton and the de Pina algorithm, two popular [[MCB-greedy method]]s to derive minimal cycle bases from a given graph in a finite number field, are described.
