A minimal cycle base (MCB) is a cycle base of minimal length (i.e. sum of the length of all cycles).

It has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every MCB has the same histogram as every other MCB
\item Every cycle in the MCB is elementary
\item Every cycle in the MCB is chordless (i.e. for all nodes in the cycle, it contains all edges between them in the cycle)
\item Every cycle in the MCB is isometric (i.e. the length of the cycle in the full graph equals the length of it in the graph induced by the cycle)
\item Every cycle in the MCB is edge-short (i.e. for every edge there are two shortest paths from the head and tail resp. that join in a node of this cycle (for uneven cycles) or an edge of this cycle (for even cycles))
\end{itemize}
